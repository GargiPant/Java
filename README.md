# Airline Reservation System

We want to create an Airline Reservation System to manage flight schedules, bookings, and seat availability for domestic and international flights. It should handle concurrent bookings, alert users of full flights, and display dynamic pricing, onboard services, and add-ons. Successful bookings should generate an invoice, while unavailable bookings should show a prompt. Managers should be able to update schedules and generate reports on fully booked flights, peak booking periods, and popular routes. Travelers should be able to search flights, book tickets, and view invoices.

---

## Requirements

* **Add Flight:** The manager can add a flight with all its details to the dataset.
* **Depart Flight:** The manager can depart a flight, removing it from the schedule.
* **Delete Flight:** The manager can delete the flight, removing it from the dataset.
* **Report:** A statistical report consisting of:
  * Departed flights
  * Frequent destinations
  * Frequent departure months
  * Frequent booking periods
* **Schedule:** List of all the flights in the dataset which have not been departed.
* **Search Flight:** To search for a flight with specific details.
* **Book Tickets:** The traveler can book tickets for the flight.
* **Add-ons:** The traveler can get add-ons for the booked tickets.
* **Invoice:** A detailed report of all the tickets booked and add-ons purchased by the traveler.

# ✈️ Airline Reservation System

A comprehensive **Airline Reservation System** built using Java, JavaFX, and multithreading. It features custom exception handling, synchronized seat booking, and a responsive GUI for travelers and managers.

---

## ✅ Exception Handling

- A custom checked exception `AllSeatsBooked` is defined and thrown when all seats on an airplane are booked.
- This exception is caught immediately where it's thrown.
- Upon catching the exception, the GUI label is updated with:  
  **“All Seats have been booked.”**

---

## 🔄 Multithreading

- Each traveler initiating a booking spawns a new `Request` object (implements `Runnable`).
- This object starts a new thread to execute the `Seat.book()` method.
- The `book()` method is synchronized, allowing only one thread to access and book a seat.
- The first thread sets the seat as booked, adds the cost to the traveler’s total, updates the invoice, and increases all remaining unbooked seat prices by 10%.
- Threads accessing a seat after it has been booked will fail, preserving booking integrity.

---

## 🧩 Generic Features

- A generic class `Stack<T>` is implemented to handle different data types like `Integer`, `String`, `Airplane`, etc.
- Used to store departed flights and derive statistics from them.

---

## 🎨 JavaFX GUI Components

- **Application**: Manages the GUI thread.
- **Stage & Scene**: Containers for the user interface.
- **AnchorPane & GridPane**: Layouts used to organize UI components.
- **UI Controls**:
  - `Label`, `Button`, `TextField`, `PasswordField`, `ListView`, `ToggleButton`, `CheckBox`
  - `ToggleButton`: Represents seats in the airplane.
  - `TextField`: Accepts user input for search and operations.
  - `PasswordField`: Used for secure manager login.
  - `ListView`: Displays available airplanes and other lists.
  - `CheckBox`: Enables addon selection for flights.

---

## ⚙️ JavaFX Functional Elements

### Layout & Alignment
- `Pos`, `HPos`, `VPos`: Used for node alignment inside layout panes.

### Event Handling
- `EventHandler<ActionEvent>`: Manages user interactions like button clicks.

### Collections
- `ObservableList<T>`: Represents dynamic lists that update UI components.
- `FXCollections`: Converts arrays or lists into `ObservableList`.
- `FilteredList<T>`: Enables search/filter functionality on flight lists.

### Styling
- `Font`: Customizes the appearance (size, weight) of UI text elements.

---

## 🔗 Property Binding and Observables

- `BooleanProperty`, `DoubleProperty`, `IntegerProperty`: Observable wrappers with binding support.
- `ChangeListener`: Responds to changes in observable properties.
- `BooleanBinding`: Binds to all seat `booked` properties.
  - Returns `true` automatically when all seats are booked.
  - Used to detect when the airplane is fully booked.

---

This system demonstrates robust use of:
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **JavaFX UI design**
- **Thread Safety with Synchronization**
- **Custom Exception Handling**
- **Generic Classes**
- **Dynamic and Reactive GUI Components**

It is ideal for students, developers, and anyone learning advanced Java development with GUI and concurrency.
